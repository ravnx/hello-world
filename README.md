# hello-world

Hey all, messing with branches on github. Maybe I'll actually start working on stuff, or putting things up here. I should paste up my vimrc and muttrc stuff. 

By day I work on a ton of linux servers, and manage an ISP network, write perl, python, php code, and oversee day to day operations.
